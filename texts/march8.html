      <div class="mainText">
        Shadowheart and Nocturne were at the conclave. Both of them were friends since they saw each other. The other
        sharrans apprentice always teased Shadowheart for her name choice. They always bullied her for that. Today, was
        one of the worst days of that bullying. She got beaten down by a few older girls. She tried to stand tall. They
        said to her. <em>“Do you actually think, chosing that name will make the Lady Shar love you more. You’re
          pathetic”</em> Said one of the leaders before striking her in her leg and Shadowheart felt on the ground. It
        was a great name, she was proud to have chosen that one, even tho the others might not like it. She saw Nocturne,
        that little purple tiefling held out a hand to her. <em>“Thank you”</em> She looked at them and said. <em>“What
          are friends for?”</em> She was so happy to have Nocturne as a friend.

      <div class="mainText2">Nocturne led Shadowheart somewhere she’s never been. <em>“I want to show you
          something.”</em> She was watching as there was that little hideout full of night orchids. It was so beautiful.
        Nocturne, placed a little blanket on the grass. <em>“It’s beautiful”</em> Nocturne smiled at the half elf. <em>“I
          found that place a few days ago. I wanted to show it to you.”</em> This was something that meant a lot for
        Shadowheart. Nocturne meant a lot to her. She touched gently the tiefling’s hand. <em>“Thank you for
          everything”</em> Shadowheart hugged Nocturne. The tiefling pulled out two books and there was a huge smile on
        the half elf’s face. <em>“You know me so well.”</em>
      </div>


      <div class="mainText2">This was the only memory Shadowheart had from her childhood, and she was so happy to be
        able to share this with her friends, the people who grew closer among their adventure. She leaned on Wyll’s
        shoulder when she told this story.

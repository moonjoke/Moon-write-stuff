          Wyll died today, they had a wonderful life together. Astarion never
          loved someone as much as he loved the blade of Avernus. The stars were
          shinning really brightly tonight. Of course, the pale elf knew that
          this moment was going to happen one day, and he did start to prepare
          for it, especially in the last days of Wyll’s life. After a life of
          adventuring, old age claimed him. The stars and the moon were almost
          soothing to him tonight, like they were here to comfort him. Almost if
          Selûne was behind this, after all, she might be the only god that they
          haven’t pissed off during their adventures. Just thinking about their
          adventure made him sad and nostalgic. He remembered how he first met
          Wyll. The heard shooting and the Emerald Grove was being attacked by a
          small group of goblins. Wyll came heroically jumping to defend the
          grove, saying
          <em>“Damnable roach. Provoke the blade and suffer its sting”</em>
          Wyll was a hero, someone in shinning armour. He made it up on the spot
          because he doesn’t remember his childhood, but he thought at that
          moment that Wyll would have been the type of man he would have wanted
          to marry as a kid.

          He was touching his wedding band, the light from the stars and the
          moon made it easy to read what was engraved on it:
          <strong>I love you</strong>. Astarion did take Wyll’s wedding band
          before they took him away, and he put it as a necklace. This way, Wyll
          would never leave him and would be forever with him. He still couldn’t
          take his wedding band off to put it on the necklace with Wyll’s, it
          was too soon. He still felt like Wyll would at any point come behind
          him and kiss him. The vampire was lying on the grass and his mind
          wandered to their wedding day. He didn’t want a wedding, but it was
          important for Wyll so he went along with it. Wyll was the most
          beautiful man on that day and each day since he first saw him. It was
          such a beautiful ceremony. There was some decoration that combined
          both of their own tastes.

        <div class="mainText2">
          Astarion felt so lucky to have been able to share those decades with
          such an incredible man as Wyll. Now he was back to being alone, well,
          he still had his friends, but they weren’t Wyll. Losing the person you
          love the most in the whole world can definitely be something
          incredible difficult to overcome. He had to find a way to be okay
          again, somehow. Tears felt down his cheeks. Why did Wyll have to go?
          Why couldn’t he have been immortal and stayed with him? He was crying
          all the tears in his body. He felt like a shadow-touch on his
          shoulder, like he was just next to him, but he knew that it was
          impossible. The stars were such a beautiful sight in the sky. His
          heart was very heavy. Those decades of love, care washed away ths
          century of abused, slavery he suffered.

          He spent the whole night there, and he saw the sun starting to rise.
          For half a second, a thought crossed his mind. Maybe he could join
          Wyll and they could be together forever? It was at this moment that
          suddenly as he rose to greet the sun that he felt the tingle on his
          skin, but half a second later he was in the safety of the shadow.
          <em>“What…what happened?”</em> He turned his head to see a wizard.
          <em>“Looks like I came at the right moment.”</em> Gale looked at
          Astarion who felt on his knee crying. <em>“He is gone…”</em> He came
          really close to Astarion and started to hug the vampire spawn, letting
          him cry on his shoulder. <em>“I’m sorry Astarion.”</em>

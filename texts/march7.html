        Gale, Ryea, Astarion and Karlach were at sorcerous sundries. There was a book that Gale wanted to read to learn
        about Netherese magic he saw from his own eyes a few days earlier from the crown that was sitting inside on the
        elder brain’s head. Gale had the book in his hand and read it. He realized what that book was actually about. He
        looked at his boyfriend and then just said. <em>“This book is far more than what I thought it would be. It
          contains Karsus’s plan for godhood. The crown, the stones, it makes so much sense.”</em> He looked at the man
        he loved when he said, <em>“Godhood? I know crowns are an ego booster, but still”</em> Gale was so happy about
        his finding. If he found the fragments again, he could maybe try to claim godhood. He had such an ego boost from
        that thought. He looked at Ryea before replying. <em>“Why not? Crowns are such a symbol of power. Please, all I
          ask you is to not dismiss this out of hand too quickly.”</em> He looked at the book before giving back to
        Ryea. He wanted to keep that book, but it was Ryea who found it.

      <div class="mainText2">Gale wanted to try to claim this power, maybe this time he would be able to show everyone that he was worth
        something. His ex asked of him that he blow himself up. Sometimes he felt so worthless, and this godhood would
        mean that he would be worthy of everyone. He knew that somehow he was already worthy in Ryea’s eyes, but that
        wasn’t sure to make his doubt aside. When they got back to the elfsong, Elminster was waiting, and he seemed to
        be happy to see him alive. He came to ask him to go talk to Mystra. He looked empty after all this. The wizard
        overheard Jaheira talking about the fact that Elminster talked too much with his pointy hat, and it made him
        smile a little.

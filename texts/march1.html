        <h1 class="title">Astarion's parents</h1>

        <div class="mainText">
          Astarion grew up in a wealthy family. His family always looked out
          that he had everything he needed except what he may have needed the
          most: affection. He grew up sheltered from the world beyond the gates
          of the upper city. His mother and his father were always working and
          making sure that their son lived up to their expectation.
        </div>
        <div class="mainText2">
          Finding his own way was something that was quite complicated for the
          high elf. His father was himself a magistrate and he wanted his son to
          follow in his footpath. Even tho Astarion had no real idea how the
          real world worked beyond the gates of the upper city he became a
          magistrate with an education but not enough knowledge on the world to
          make good decisions.
        </div>
        <div class="mainText2">
          In general, his parents were always more focused on keeping their
          public image and spoiling their son with gifts and money rather than
          actually focusing on him. They may not even have realized that one day
          he just disapeared after Cazador enslaved him.

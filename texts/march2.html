                It's been a few hours, since Astarion said he would be back soon for
                trying to find something on four legs to feed. Wyll started to get
                worried about the elf. He was in his tent, he cared deeply about
                Astarion, but he didn't know how he could tell him this. Wyll got up
                and started to change shoes to go look for the spawn. There were so
                many thoughts in his head that something could have gone wrong, what
                if he went after something too big for him. Wyll knew that Astarion
                was more than capable of defending himself in front of an animal, but
                that didn't stop his mind from painting tragedies. He closed his eyes
                and started to walk toward the forest, the place where he last saw
                Astarion before he ventured into the forest to feed himself.

            <div class="mainText2">
                After sometimes, he managed to find the elf and he was fine. He let
                out a deep sight of relief. Astarion was leaning against a rock, it
                seemed he was able to find something to eat.
                <em>“Are you alright, Astarion?”</em> Asked the human. It hasn’t been
                very long since he first met the elf, but he couldn’t help it to try
                to make sure everyone was alright. Astarion met Wyll’s gaze and the
                human saw something in his eyes, it wasn’t hunger, it was sadness and
                anxiety. <em>“Why are you still up Wyll?”</em> He knelt in front of
                Astarion. <em>“I was worried about you.”</em> There was no point in
                lying about why he was here. Wyll asked,
                <em>“Is it okay if I put my hand on your shoulder?”</em> They had
                talked about what happened to Astarion in his past, and he wanted to
                make sure he would be comfortable with physical touch.
                <em>“I…”</em> This question surprised Astarion because he was so used
                to people, well, mostly Cazador using him to get what he wanted. Never
                asking, it was something new for the elf, but he welcomed the question
                and also the gesture. <em>“Yes”</em> When Astarion gave Wyll the
                answer, he gently put his hand on Astarion’s shoulder. It was a
                comforting touch.
                <em>“If you ever want to talk about anything. You know that I’m
                    here”</em>
            </div>

            <div class="mainText2">
                Astarion never had someone look out for him like Wyll is doing right
                now. It was such a new sensation, to be cared for, to be loved. Old
                instinct were trying to kick in and just tried to flirt and seduce
                him. He cared for the human more than what he would like to admit.
                Just Wyll touching so delicately, so carefully his shoulder. This made
                him smile. <em>“Thank you Wyll”</em> Wyll smiled and simply said
                <em>“What else are friends for?”</em> Right, they were friends and
                nothing more. He saw Wyll get up and offer him a hand to help him up,
                and he happily took this hand. The moon was almost inviting them to
                spend more time here, together with this silvery glow making the night
                almost magical. They got back to camp and each went back to their own
                tent separately. <em>“Good night Astarion”</em> Astarion saw Wyll’s
                smile, and he smiled back at him. <em>“Sleep well, Wyll”</em><br />

            <div class="mainText2">
                Wyll was beating himself for saying the word friends once he got back
                into his own tent. It was true that they were friends, but he did want
                more. He knew what he could do, prepare something that maybe Astarion
                would like…

            <h1 class="title">Ryea is sick, what happens?</h1>

            <div class="mainText">
                Gale looked at Ryea who was visibly paler than normal, something
                wasn’t right with the man of his life. He was determined to find out
                what was wrong with him. <em>“Are you feeling alright?”</em> The
                wizard sat next to the sorcerer on their bed. It felt almost like Ryea
                was too sick to reply.
                <em>“I think… I don’t know. My head feels like it’s on fire”</em> Gale
                went to the kitchen and came back with tea. He put it on his husband’s
                night stand.
                <em>“You should try to rest a little. I’ll try to find something in my
                    books”</em><br />
            </div>

            <div class="mainText2">
                Gale was worried that he might not find anything, maybe it was just a
                little cold and nothing more serious. He kissed the love of his life
                on the forehead before going back to the library. His mind was going a
                thousand miles per hour. He was worried sick that something might be
                killing the person he cared for the most in this life.
                <em>“This cannot be happening.”</em> He murmured to himself. He needed
                to find the answer to help Ryea. Gale was a wizard, he should know
                something to help him.<br />
            </div>

            <div class="mainText2">
                Tara came rushing in. <em>“I came as soon as I heard Gale.”</em> Gale
                smiled at the tressym and gave her a little scratch.
                <em>“I’m scared Tara”</em> Tara rolled her eyes a little before trying
                to slap some sense into him.
                <em>“You know, if my memory serves, you have a friend who is a cleric.
                    How about you try to contact Shadowheart?”</em>
                The wizard smiled at the tressym.
                <em>“I’m being silly again, am I not?”</em> Tara offered a comforting
                look.
                <em>“You’re just worried, but you’re more than capable to solve this
                    with the help of your friends.”</em>
                Tara was right, Gale needed to contact Shadowheart, but he had no idea
                where she was right now.
                <em>“Would it be possible for you, Tara, to go and try to find
                    her?”</em>
                Tara flies away to try to find the cleric of the moon.<br />
            </div>

            <div class="mainText2">
                He got out of his library and went to hold Ryea’s hand,
                <em>“Where does it hurt?”</em> Gale held the sorcerer’s hand. _"It’s
                mostly my head but also my stomach.
                <em>" I’ll stay with you, Tara is getting your favourite cleric."</em>
                Gale saw the smile crossing Ryea’s face when he said the words “your
                favourite cleric”. Ryea tried to kiss him.
                <em>“Maybe we should wait until we find out if it’s contagious”</em>
                This made Ryea laugh a little, but he showed that his left side hurt a
                little.
                <em>“If I’m sick, and it’s contagious, there’s a high chance you
                    already caught it.”</em>
                Gale leaned over and kissed his husband.<br />
            </div>

            <div class="mainText2">
                After some moment, Gale also started to feel not well. He laid down
                next to Ryea, but it seemed it affected him than the person he loved,
                who started to show signs of a fever. <em>“I’m so tired”</em> That
                sentenced started to worry Gale a lot. He still held him close to him.
                <em>“It will be alright, you’ll get better.”</em> Gale wasn’t ready to
                lose the person that he loved. It wasn’t something that Gale could
                handle. It’s been a couple of years that these two got married, but he
                was still thinking about the worst-case scenario. Ryea already had a
                very pale complexion, but right now, it was even worse than before.
                Gale was too focused on Ryea to realize that he himself was almost as
                pale as a ghost. He still held on to the person he loved the most.
                Gale cried while holding him.<br />
            </div>

            <div class="mainText2">
                He then woke up and realized it was just a very real nightmare. Both
                were really sick and felt like it was ending. Then Shadowheart
                arrived. <em>“Gods below, it’s worse than I thought”</em> She looked
                at Gale and Ryea but luckily enough for them. It was something she
                knew how to cure. <em>“You two look like ghosts.”</em> Gale looked at
                her and just said,
                <em>“Please, just save him. I can’t live without him”</em> She laughed
                a little.
                <em>“Now you’re just being dramatic, you’re both going to be fine”</em>

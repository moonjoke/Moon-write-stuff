                They were at the elfsong tavern, they rented a room upstairs. Chris and Astarion were cuddling together.
                <i>"How are you feeling, love?"</i> Chris looked at Astarion in his eyes. What the pale elf saw when he
                looked inside those red crimson eyes that previously were an intense green, was hurt. <i>"I'm hungry.
                    I'm constantly hungry."</i> Hearing those words come out of Chris's mouth hurt him a lot. <i>"I know
                    my love. I'll teach you how to control those urges"</i> If Chris remembered what Astarion said a few
                days ago in the shadowland, he would know that that hunger will never go away. It will never be sated
                enough. Astarion wanted the power of the ascended to be able to not feel that hunger, but now it was
                completely off the table. Raphael's words echoed in his mind that Cazador will have to sacrifice all of
                his vampire spawns. This included Chris... He was willing to sacrifice the others, but now that Chris
                was probably bound to this ritual? It was over. No one will see that power.

            <div class="mainText2">
                Astarion looked at Chris, he was still so weak. He needed to go fight Cazador. He needed to make him
                pay. He looked at Chris that was sleeping on his bed. the elf walked toward Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart
                and Jaheira. <i>"We have to take down Cazador."</i> He then added in his mind <i>I'm not letting him
                    touch Chris with his control</i> He looked at them. <i>"He has to die before Chris is better."</i>
                Wyll looked at the elf. He was worried about him but he knew better than to say otherwise. <i>"You're
                    right, he has to die."</i> Wyll looked toward Chris who was just lying there. He knew that if
                Cazador had control over him, it would be too dangerous. Astarion looked at Gale. <i>"You don't mind
                    staying back to stay for him? You're his best friend. If he wakes up, he will need you."</i> Gale
                smiled at Astarion and just replied. <i>"Not at all"</i> The wizard looked at Halsin. <i>"He might need
                    some healing, will you also stay?"</i> The big bear looked at them and said. <i>"Of course, they
                    have Jaheira. I can stay back"</i> Karlach looked at them all. <i>"Alright, let's do this."</i>
            </div>
            <div class="mainText2">
                Astarion, Karlach, Wyll, Shadowheart and Jaheira made their way toward the palace again. This time it
                would get better. They arrived just in front of the door that lead to Cazador. <i>"Everyone has to be on
                    their guard"</i> He looked at Shadowheart. <i>"Remember daylight is one of the weakness of a
                    vampire."</i> Shadowheart nodded, and they finished planning, and they confronted Cazador.

            <div class="mainText2">
                Cazador was on the ground. <i>"This is me, this is for Chris. This is for everything you ever did to me.
                    You're a monster."</i> Astarion landed the fatal blow to Cazador. They released the other spawns.
                The pale elf didn't ascend. He looked at Cazador's body. <i>"I feel so empty. He's dead and I can't even
                    feel like I can celebrate."</i> Karlach hugged the spawn and she simply said. <i>"Let's go back to
                    our room, soldier."</i>

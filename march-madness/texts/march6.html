        <h1 class="title">Karlach gets angry, why?</h1>

        <div class="mainText">
          Karlach looked with horror at what just happened in front of her. She
          couldn’t believe what they just did. They really just condemned Wyll
          to be a lemur fighting for Zariel in the blood war. She turned her
          eyes to Tav.
          <em>“With just a press of a leaver. You killed Wyll.”</em> Karlach was
          furious about what just happened. She actually had a hard time
          believing that Tav would do that. Karlach adored Wyll, that man gave
          up so much for her to keep her alive. She was filed with a mix of
          different emotions, sadness, grief and anger. When Tav tried to
          approach her after this, she just backed away.
          <em>“No, give me time. A lot of it.”</em> She sounded cold and angry
          at the same time.

        <div class="mainText2">
          In her mind, she had a really hard time forgiving what they just did.
          Astarion was right next to her when this happened, and he laid a hand
          on her shoulder and just whispered.
          <em>“I’m sorry, he deserved better.”</em> She could see the hurt in
          his eyes. Karlach knew how much Wyll meant to Astarion. These two were
          growing closer by the minute. Karlach was furious at Tav for doing
          this. They had no right to do this to Wyll, even if that meant letting
          Mizora live. For the rest of the colony, she didn’t talk much, wasn’t
          very enthusiastic about anything. When they faced Ketheric Thorm, she
          saw him : Gortash. What was that fucker doing here? Was he somehow
          behind this? She couldn’t believe her eyes. That man sold her to
          Zariel 10 years ago. She was enraged. How he spoke, she picked up that
          he followed Bane, the god of tyranny. She backed away, realising she
          had been protecting a banite before he sold her to Zariel. All she
          thought was that she was so blind to have not seen it earlier. She
          couldn’t wait to flatten him and get her revenge.

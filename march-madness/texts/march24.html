            <h2 class="subtitle">aka Astarion's worst nightmare part 3</h2>

            <div class="mainText">
                Chris and Astarion were both vampires spawn of Cazador, even tho he was dead, this didn't change it.
                Astarion was staying on Chris's side when he was sleeping. He didn't want to leave him alone. He felt it
                was his fault that Chris was now a vampire spawn. The elf remembered his emerald green eyes with such
                precision and would make sure to remember it for Chris if he ever forgets what he looked like before he
                got changed. He was touching Chris's arm. He silently whispered <i>"I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been
                    through this."</i> Astarion didn't realize that Chris was awake when he said this. Chris got up and
                held Astarion in his arms. <i>"It's not your fault, Astarion"</i> They were both seated on Chris's bed.
                Astarion cracked a little joke <i>"Well, at least I won't have to decide what to do with that bloody
                    ritual."</i> Of course, Astarion was still thinking about it. The opportunity to become the vampire
                ascendant, a <i>living</i> vampire. It wasn't anyone's fault but Cazador's. He knew it, but his mind
                went still in those places.

            <div class="mainText2">
                Astarion put his hand on Chris's back, and he suddenly realized something, <i>"You're bleeding..."</i>
                Chris was almost on the verge of crying when Astarion said something about his back bleeding. <i>"I
                    know..."</i> Astarion got Chris back for a few hours. He didn't realize it before. The rage inside
                of him started to burn very bright. He tried to remain as calm as he could. <i>"Can I see your back,
                    please?"</i> Chris froze in place when he heard what Astarion said. The elf looked at the man that
                he loved, he could almost feel that he knew exactly what was underneath. When Chris really slowly
                started to take his shirt off. It broke something inside Astarion. To see the man that he loved has
                suffered the same thing that he did, well, Chris's scars were fresh. He started to cry. Chris held
                Astarion's face and kissed him. <i>"Cazador is dead, he's not a threat to us, and we'll live, we'll find
                    away that after all of this we'll still be able to walk in the sun."</i>

            </div>
            <div class="mainText2">
                Chris looked at Astarion in his eyes <i>"I loved you yesterday, I love you today, and I'll love you
                    until we die"</i> Astarion was stunted by what Chris just said. He looked into his lover's red eyes.
                <i>"I don't deserve you, Chris. You would have every right to break up with me after... well,
                    everything..."</i> He knew how much this wasn't something Chris said lightly. He took a deep breath
                before continuing. <i>"I love you too, Chris."</i> Astarion still didn't feel like he deserved Chris.
                Did he say the "I love you" just to reassure Chris, for himself? He didn't know himself. He loved Chris
                deeply, but he felt he didn't deserve that man. <i>"I'm sincere Astarion, all you did since back in
                    Moonrise, you told me that you did manipulate me at the start, you always just showed care, you were
                    always here for me if I needed to talk to someone. You're the person I love the most, the love of my
                    life, you're my best friend."</i> There was a slight smile on Astarion's face when Chris said this.
                <i>"Chris...."</i> he started to say before being cut off my Chris by a kiss. He loved that man so much.
